# QuirkyPSFunctions
Functions I use every day that aren't employer or customer specific. 

When I end up doing something more than once I put it in here, so I will always remember where it is.  They're not at all ready for prime time, they just work for me.

If you (and you shouldnt) have tried to build this, you'll know that the build is broken right now:  I have been looking at other PS projects and am taking lots of new build ideas from them. Unfortunately, they're just not quite ready yet.
